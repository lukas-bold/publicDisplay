## Make it work:

- Install nodejs on your system
- execute install.bat in the main directory (or run `npm i` on your console)
- use the dropbox-client to sync your slide images and markdown-files with the `slides` folder (*Side Note:* images in the `image partials` folder wont be rendered as slides)
- to start the presentation execute install.bat from the main directory (or run `grunt serve` on your console)
